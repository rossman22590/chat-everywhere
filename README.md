# Chat Everywhere by [Explorator Labs](https://exploratorlabs.com) 

[中文版](https://intro.chateverywhere.app/README-zh.html)

Chat Everywhere is an app designed to showcase the capabilities of Large Language Models and make them accessible to everyone without login or geo-restrictions. Our community has contributed valuable feedback during the app's development, resulting in additional features not found in the official ChatGPT.

## Additional Features
- Folder structures
- Prompt templates
- Import/Export conversations
- Delete message
- Multi language support
> ^Thanks to the [open-source community](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui)
- Share conversations
- Internet connected enhance mode (Beta)
- Respond Language selection (Coming up)

## Origins

This project is forked from [Chatbot UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui), an initiative by [Mckay](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley) to build a superior and open-source user interface compared to the official one.

## Project Funding plan

[Explorator Labs](https://exploratorlabs.com) is committed to lowering barriers to accessing technology like ChatGPT by pledging a fixed monthly budget, making this project available without the need for login or payment.

As the popularity of Chat Everywhere has grown, we are facing challenges in covering the increased costs, which now exceed USD $2k per month. In the coming weeks, we will introduce a paid account feature to support the project's sustainability and enable us to develop more advanced functionalities for all users!
